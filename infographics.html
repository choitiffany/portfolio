                <h2><em>Gifting in the form of infographics</em></h2>
                    <p>For Christmas I wanted to give my close friends a gift that showed how much I appreciated our friendship. However, as a college student I couldn't afford to buy the most expensive gifts so I decided to go a different route and give something more meaningful. I designed personalized infographic posters for each of them that documented some of our adventures, inside-jokes, and memories over the past year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This poster was for my roommate Cindy, documenting our food related memories together since 2015 was all about food. It was the year we took on the challenge of writing 100 Yelp reviews and the year we were accepted as Yelp elites.</p>

                    <p>This past summer I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Europe with my friend (also named) Tiffany. A lot can happen when you spend almost every minute together with someone for a month, from all the many times of getting lost to all the new and exciting new foods we got to try.</p>
