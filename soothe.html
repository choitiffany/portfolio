                    <h2>Problem </h2>
                        <p>Most cough drops full of sugar which defeats the purpose if the user's goal is to get healthier. The small size of a cough drop is also a choking hazard for children. Current packaging for cough drops are either made from paper but usually has no resealable element (which causes the cough drops to spill all over the place if not put away properly)or if they do come in resealable packaging, are made from material that cannot be easily recycled. </p>

                    <h2> Solution </h2>
                        <p>Soothe is a cough lollipop that is safe for children to consume. It's made with all natural ingredients such as herbs and honey to soothe sore throats and fight coughs naturally while also helping your body get healthier. The packaging is environmentally friendly and can be recycled. It contains a resealable component to eliminate the mess created when cough drops spill out of its bag.

                    <h2> Role </h2>
                        <p> I designed the logo and visual identity for Soothe, including the business system and website. I also developed packaging that is more environmentally friendly and is resealable.</p>

                        <p> The inside of the box will contain a smaller hexagonal box with holes poked through to hold the lollipops together so that they can stand inside the box.This allows for a more organized way of packaging the lolli- pops instead of just tossing them into a bag or box. The action of picking a lollipop out of the box also mimics picking the leaves off of a plant.</p>
