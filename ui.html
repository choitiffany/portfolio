                                <p> I ordered a planner from Mochi Things and was quite disappointed that the email receipt was visually lacking compared the the aesthetics of the planner that I bought and the rest of the merchandise that the site sells.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p> I redesigned it to be more visually pleasing and incoporate more visual hierarchy to help users easily and quickly understand and find information. The total amount spent is very easy to find in case of mistakes with the purchase because that would be a big concern to the user. The design is simple so that important information can be easily found, such as tracking of the shipping address. </p>

                    <h2> Weather Web App </h2>
                         <p> A weather web app that was presented to a beginning computer science class at UC Davis for students to build. This design focuses on simplicity so that the user can easily get the information they need (the weather for the day). It also incorporates little things such as a small message on what to wear as a way to keep the interface engaging and friendly. </p>
